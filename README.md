# Hey, I'm Manas 👋

**UX & Human Factors Researcher** exploring the intersection of design, research, and AI-native development.

I spend my days understanding how people interact with complex systems—from public safety tools to emerging AI workflows. I'm currently exploring **vibe coding** and building with AI agents to prototype faster and think bigger.

## What I'm Into

🔬 **Research & Design** – User research, interaction design, and translating insights into products that people actually want to use. 3+ years at Motorola Solutions working with 1,000+ public-safety users.

🤖 **AI-Native Development** – Experimenting with agentic workflows, prompt strategies, and how AI can augment design thinking. I use Claude, Windsurf, and Claude Code to iterate on ideas rapidly.

⚙️ **Vibe Coding** – Building prototypes that feel right before optimizing the details. Less rigid planning, more exploratory iteration with AI agents as thinking partners.


## My Toolkit

- **Design & Prototyping** – Figma, Axure, Adobe XD, Sketch
- **AI-Assisted Development** – Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT Codex
- **Code** – React, TypeScript, Python, TensorFlow.js (Vibes Only)
- **Research** – Mixed methods, task analysis, usability testing, telemetry analysis
- **Accessibility** – WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, inclusive design practices
